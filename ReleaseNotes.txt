# 2.2.9
fix: fixed error with instantiated generic method on types (which is impossible in normal conditions, but fine for Unity AOT runtime).

# 2.2.8
- made AotCompilation.IsAotRuntime is mutable, this will allow to signal for AOT runtime and suppress further checks.

# 2.2.7
- added public CSharpExpression.Format method for SyntaxTreeNode

# 2.2.6
- changed order or SyntaxTreeNode fields and added "original C# expression" field to parsed AST.
- refactored C# expression rendering to support null-propagation expressions, type aliases (int, byte, object ...),
- renamed "Render" methods to "FormatAsCSharp". Now it is "formatting"
- moved c# "formatting" methods to CSharpExpression class
- mark old "Parse" functions as errors
- mark old "Render" methods as obsolete
- renamed CSharpExpressionFormatter to CSharpExpressionFormatter
- fixed indexer experssion rendering
- refactored NameUtils to properly render C# type names

# 2.2.5
renamed ParseTreeNode.Lexeme to .Token
renamed few member of TokenType for better clarity
added documentation file in Unity project assets
changed 'propertyOrFieldName' attribute to 'name' in SyntaxTreeNode
renamed PropertyOfFieldBinder to MemberBinder
changed 'PropertyOrField' expression type to 'MemberResolve' in SyntaxTreeNode
added backward compatibility checks in all related classes

# 2.2.4
added protection against wrong expressions like 'a b' which later bound as 'b'
fixed some tokenization errors:
- 'issa'scanned as 'is'[Operator] and 'sa'[Identifier], now as 'issa'
- '.09' scanned as '.'[Operator] and '09'[Number], now as '0.09'
- '0.1x' scanned as '0.1'[Number] and 'x'[Identifier], now cause error
added method call support for numbers (example 1.ToString())
added short number notation (examples '.9' for '0.9')
added '@' prefix for identifiers (example '@is') https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/tokens/verbatim
done small Tokenizer optimization (reduced string allocation during scanning)

# 2.2.3
added ExpressionPacker type. This type allows packing/unpacking expressions into primitive structures (Dictionaries, Arrays...). These structures  could be serialized and wired by network or stored for future use.
added better error message for some binding cases
denying call to 'Type.InvokeMember' if 'Type' is not within 'known types'.

# 2.2.2
* fixed conditional operator (a ? b : c) parsing with method call in place of 'b'

# 2.2.1
* fixed IL2CPP compilation error due _Attribute interface complilation failure
* added few interfaces to AOT.cs file for better AOT coverage

# 2.2.0
Features
* added support for void expressions (Action<> delegates)
* added support of '.NET Standart 1.3' and '.NET Core 2.0' platforms
